The town is busy celebrating winters crest, eveyone you meet
greets you well. It's clear the people of Miribar love this time of year.

The snowfall has been getting stronger and it really feels like a winter wonderland.

Children are playing games in the streets, parents laugh and joking with friends.

You overhear two halfling girls talking about monsters...

<b>Vicelin Grubb</b> "Some say its a monster, a big pruple worm with massive teeth!"
<b>Alicia Nalor</b> "It's not true..."
<b>Vicelin Grubb</b> "Tis... it comes out of the ground and eats kids it dose."

<b>Melody Lowther (Mother)</b> "Hush now child, dont talk silly nonsense"
