This large cabin has been transformed into a gambling hall.

The centerpiece of which is a gold-plated wooden sculpture of a goose that hangs from the ceiling.

Most of the floor space is taken up with tables of casino games.

Attractive dealers sit behind the tables wearing gold waistcoats and ties and golden robin hod like hats.

<b>Before Nobles Arrive:</b> 
They are waiting expectantly for their guests to arrive.

They don't need to wait long as noblemen and women start to enter the cabin and then descend to the tables.


<b>With Nobles</b>
Noblemen and women fill every inch of this converted riverboat.

The gambling and debauchery start in earnest, many consume free alcohol, drugs and lude acts.

You see a human female with long silky black hair being held together with two ornate sticks thought and a golden robe, with 2 large embroidered green snakes patrols the gambling hall, smiling at guests while watching intensely!
