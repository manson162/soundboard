Later on, an older looking male human enters the room with a large red octopus on his shoulder.

He wears a plush looking set of leather armor that has adornments all over it.

He has a think white handlebar mustache and wears a tight-fitting leather cap.

He is busy shaking with nobles, he's clearly trying very hard to make friends and influence people. 

From time to time he stops he winces in pain touching the side of his temple.

<b>Drylundâ€™s betrayal </b>

Soon after informing you about the ship, Lord Drylund starts to look very unwell, his skin looks clamy.

He reaches his hand to his temple.

His eyes seem to role into the back of his head.

Blood starts to pour from his nose and ears and eyes.

He falls to his knees, and then slumps to the floor.... blood pooling all around him.
