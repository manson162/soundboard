Standing on the east bank of the Dessarin River is the prosperous city of Yartar.

You see many new and old builds. 

Many stretching four stories high.

It's clear a lot of money has been invested into the city.

The stone walls of Yartar are about 15ft high and look to be well defended.

The city is surrouned by lots of framland.

<b>From the west?</b>
You see a massive barracks connected to a large stable, you see counless city gaurd coming
and going. 

Some are mounted on horseback, some polishing their boots and others heading
into the city over a large wooden bridge. ....

<b>Enter the city</b>
Your welcomed along with many others traveling to trade with the people of Yartar.

Most people look frienly or at least friendly enough, there is an air of pomp and circimstance.

The place is well kept and you see that builds look all mismatched, like they have been rebuilt
many times.
