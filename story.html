You see a heavying mass of people, talking about the fighting pits, they all seem to excited to see blood.

They are heading down a passageway down under the city. Do you follow?

You come to a mighty stone gladiator colosseum.

Its about 200ft across being held aloft by 4 massive stone pillars.

As you arrive the crowd <a href="">cheer</a> as you see a blooded human laying facedown in the sand.

His face looks utterly destroyed.

<b>Into Morgan</b>

Standing above him is a short figure around 5 foot wearing leather armour over a rough black tunic with a lose hood.

Out of this extends a large eagle-like beak. It's hard to make out the face but it seems to be covered in dusty orange feathers.

On it's back are two bandaged up masses that look like they could conceal wings.

Two men come forward and and drags the fallen contestant, still face down out of the ring.

You hear a voice from the stands... ladies and gentlemen who dare challenge the victor?

<b>Into Andy</b>
You large signs up everywhere that say "No Betting" but it seems that most people are ignoring the notices.

One man in particular seems to do very well... Hes about 5 foot something, reddish hair.

Fairly expensive clothes which are starting to wear.

Two rapiers on left side. A sagging green cap with a drooping feather
